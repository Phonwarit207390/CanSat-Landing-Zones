## Artificial Intelligence

- **Artificial Intelligence:** the development of computer systems that can perform tasks that would normally require human intelligence

- **Machine Learning:** a type of *Artificial Intelligence* that allows computer systems to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed

- **Deep Learning:** a subset of *Machine Learning* that uses artificial *Neural Networks* with multiple layers to model and solve complex problems

- **Neural Networks:** a set of algorithms modeled after the structure and function of the human brain

- **Computer Vision:** a field of *Artificial Intelligence* that focuses on enabling computers to interpret and understand visual information from the world around them, including images and videos

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable) to install the **Roboflow** package ([Documentation](https://docs.roboflow.com/)). 

```bash
pip install roboflow
```

## Usage

### Input

The *`images`* folder should contain:

- the *`info.json`* file containing the required information for every picture captured (*name*, center & bottom-right corner *coordinates*, image *dimensions* in px). This file is of the following format:

```json
[
    {
        "name": "image1",
        "location": [[38.055133, 23.320294], [38.052865, 23.325891]],
        "height": 682,
        "width": 1344
    }
]
```

- the pictures captured with a *`.jpg`* extension.

> Tip: Use pictures with low resolution. For example, 500 KB.

### Output

The *`data`* folder will contain:

- the *`data.csv`* file with the GPS coordinates. This file is of the following format:

```csv
latitude,longitude
38.054009,23.317695
38.053956,23.323509
```

- the new pictures with the predictions, with a *`.jpg`* extension.

> Tip: For faster results comment line 23:
> ```python
> # result.save(f'data\{image["name"]}.jpg')
> ```
> This line saves the new picture with the predictions.

## Results

The *Computer Vision* model achieved high accuracy, precision, low error rates, and consistent results. View [here](/data/video.m4v).
